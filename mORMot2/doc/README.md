# mORMot Documentation

## Documentation

The *mORMot 2* documentation is available [online at Synopse.info](https://synopse.info/files/doc/mORMot2.html).

## Folder Content

This folder hosts the **source** of the documentation of the *mORMot* Open Source framework, version 2.

You should not need to read or compile it, but rather browse the generated documentation available [online at Synopse.info](https://synopse.info/files/doc/mORMot2.html).

## License

This Documentation and its source are licensed under a GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later.

## Generated From Source

The framework source code contains detailed information about most of its published data structures, as comments prefixed by `///`.

Our [SynProject tool](https://github.com/synopse/SynProject) was used to extract these description, together with the types and variables definitions themselves, and generate accurate documentation.

## High-Level Documentation

Several chapters of information have also been written as plain text, and included in this folder. It presents high-level definition of the concepts involved in *mORMot*, or low-level presentation of the framework actual implementation.

The documentation source is mainly available in the [mormot2.pro](mormot2.pro) text file.
Our [SynProject tool](https://github.com/synopse/SynProject) is the most convenient way of editing this `mormot2.pro` file content, on Windows.
