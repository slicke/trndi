# Trndi in multiple languages

Trndi can be translated to any language, providing someone is kind enough to do the translating.

In Github, you can find translations in the _lang/_ folder.

The files are named Trndi.```language code```.po 

Find out which code to use in the 
[language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) code list in Wikipedia, Trndi uses _set 1_.

In order for a language to exists, __someone must translate it first__. I welcome any one to participate in translating! Simply submit a pull request with a translated file.

## Translating
Simply open ```lang/Trndi.pot``` in [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/download), translate it and export a _.po file_!
The po file is used by Trndi to process the translations.

You will need to pull request BOTH the .mo and .po files, as the mo is required to build the po file.
