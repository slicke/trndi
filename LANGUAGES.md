Trndi can be translated to any language, providing someone is kind enough to do the translating.

In Github, you can find translations in the _lang/_ folder.

The files are named Trndi.```language code```.po

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes](anguage codes list), Trndi uses _set 1_.

In order for a language to exists, __someone must translate it first__. I welcome any one to participate in translating! Simply submit a pull request with a translated file.

## Translating
Trndi.mo is the main file, for getting the translations (in the lang/ folder).

Simply open that file in [https://poedit.net/download](PoEdit) and export a .po file!
