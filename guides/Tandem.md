# Set up Tandem

## Preparations
### Setup Tandem Source
Register on the website and install the Android/iPhone app. Then connect it to your pump.

## Setup Trndi
Open Trndi and open the settings (if they aren't alredy showing), by right-clicking and choosing settings (long-press for touch screens).

### Configuring the settings dialog
1. Use the drop-down and choose Tandem t:connect (with your region)
2. Enter your __Tandem Source e-mail__
3. Enter your __Tandem Source password__

#### Display units
4. Choose __mmol/L__ in the bottom, if you live in a country (such as Sweden) where it's used, or __mg/dL__ in countries such as the USA where that is used

Now close the window, then close Trndi (if it doesn't close itself) and start it again.

# Personal Settings
## Setting limits
Personal limits and goals, such as "values over 10.5 are high", are not provided by the Tandem servers. 

Trndi will, by default, assume values are high over 8.9mmol/L (160mg/dL), and low under 3.3 (60mg/dL). You can however __set personal levels__ in the settings, under the __Customization__ tab.

### Setting personal levels
#### Personal range
In addition to "High over" and "Low under" alarms, Trndi can also use a "personal range." Originally a NightScout feature, it allows you to set a smaller target range within the high/low range. 

This can be summarized as "While 8.9 mmol/L is high, 3 is low, my personal target is 6.0-8.2". 

As a result, you get an earlier indication before your levels actually reach "High/Low". If you turn color in the "Time-in-rage" config tab on, this can be shown on your graph's background.

### Defining the personal levels
The personal levels can be set in the settings, under the Time-in-range tab; "Override custom range".
